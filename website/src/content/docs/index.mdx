## What is Unentropy?

**Unentropy** is an open-source tool for tracking code metrics directly in your CI pipeline—without external servers, cloud dependencies, or vendor lock-in. In the age of AI-assisted development where codebases evolve faster than ever, **you can't improve what you don't measure.** Unentropy gives you the visibility to catch quality regressions early, validate refactoring progress, and ensure your codebase remains maintainable as it grows.

**Unlike traditional monitoring platforms, Unentropy puts you in complete control.** Your metrics live in your repository's workflow artifacts or your own S3-compatible storage—not on someone else's server. Your configuration is versioned alongside your code. Your data never leaves your infrastructure. Whether you're tracking standard metrics like test coverage and bundle size, or custom indicators specific to your domain (like "modern framework adoption ratio"), **you own the metrics, you own the data, and you decide what matters.** Best of all? It's fully serverless—no infrastructure to manage, no recurring cloud fees, just metrics tracking that works within your existing GitHub Actions workflow.

## Key Features

- **Built-in Metrics:** Start tracking coverage, bundle size or lines of code in minutes
- **Custom Metrics Support:** Track domain-specific indicators like framework adoption ratios, API endpoint counts, or refactoring progress using simple command outputs
- **Quality Gates:** Set thresholds and get automated PR feedback—fail the build if coverage drops or bundle size exceeds limits
- **Complete Ownership:** Store metrics in GitHub Actions artifacts or your own S3-compatible storage—your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Git-Native:** Every metric is tied to its commit SHA; configuration lives in your repo and evolves with your code
- **Trend Visualization:** Generate interactive HTML reports showing how your metrics evolve over time
