## What is Unentropy?

**Unentropy** is an open-source tool for tracking code metrics directly in your CI pipeline, based on in-repository configuration.

## Key Features

- **Built-in Metrics:** Start tracking coverage, bundle size or lines of code in minutes
- **Trend Visualization:** Generate interactive HTML reports showing how your metrics evolve over time
- **Custom Metrics Support:** Track domain-specific indicators like framework adoption ratios, API endpoint counts, or refactoring progress using simple command outputs
- **Quality Gates:** Set thresholds and get automated PR feedback—fail the build if coverage drops or bundle size exceeds limits
- **Complete Ownership:** Store metrics in GitHub Actions artifacts or your own S3-compatible storage—your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Git-Native:** Every metric is tied to its commit SHA; configuration lives in your repo and evolves with your code
